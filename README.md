# Blackjack-Basic-Strategy

## Context

This code if for the people that love to play BlackJack and want to get better at BlackJack so you can win more money
or if you want to learn to count cards it is a great help because first you have to learn the basic strategy first before learning how to count cards, so you can theoretically have perfect bets and after that you can learn the hi-low method for counting cards.

And it is based on the Basic Strategy table by the BlackJack Apprenticeship at: <br />
https://www.blackjackapprenticeship.com/blackjack-strategy-charts/

We know it is complicated to learn all the basic strategy, so we divided it into three parts/modes: <br />
1.- The first mode in which you only practice hard totals, so there is no aces involved <br />
2.- The second mode you practice soft totals, in consequence there is no figure cards or 10's in the sabot <br />
(COMING SOON) A third mode to learn overall Basic Strategy, this means combining the Hard Totals and Soft total modes in one mode <br />
We suggest you to first practice the hard and soft totals to then hop onto our third mode :^) 

## How to play 

Basically all you have to do is dowload the "basic_stratehy.py" python file, at firt a menu will be displaced so you will have to select an option to practice Hard Totals, Soft totals or the overall Basic Strategy and after selecting the mode you have to basically made the decisions base on the tables of Basic Strategy by the BlackJack Apprenticeship
