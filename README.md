# Blackjack-Basic-Strategy

## Context

This code if for the people that love to play BlackJack and want to get better at BlackJack so they win more money
or if you want to learn to count cards first you have to learn the basic strategy, so you can theoretically have perfect bets and after that you can learn the hi-low method for counting cards.

We know it is complicated to learn all the basic strategy, so we divided it into three parts/modes:
1.- The first mode in which you only practice hard totals, so there is no aces involved
2.- The second mode you practice soft totals, in consequence there is no figure cards or 10's in the sabot
3.- For the third mode is a normal basic strategy practice, basically you practice both hard and soft totals in the same mode
We suggest you to first practice the hard and soft totals to then hop onto our third mode :^) (COMING SOON)
